## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman/tree/master/linux_sql)]: I developed a system to document and store hardware specs and resource usage for a Linux cluster in PostgreSQL. I created an MVP for Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration, including scripts to gather hardware data, track server usage, and launch PostgreSQL and its docker container. This resulted in a successful functional MVP for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration.

**SQL application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman/tree/master/sql)]: This SQL project, created by me solely for learning purposes, focuses on developing and demonstrating my SQL proficiency. It involves using various SQL keywords to address specific questions and scenarios, serving as a valuable tool for skill enhancement. Additionally, it showcases my ability to design and implement complex database queries.

**Grep app** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman/tree/master/core_java)]: The Grep application, written in Java, emulates the functionality of the Linux grep command. This application scans files, identifies lines that match a given regular expression, and saves them to a file. It starts its search from a designated root directory, conducting a recursive search across all directories and files. Developed using IntelliJ IDE, Core Java, and Maven, this application is also deployed through Docker.


## Highlighted Projects
**Image Processing Library** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bbrayan/Image_Processing_Library)]: I've developed an image processing library with a versatile toolkit, including 3x3 filter applications like edge detection, black pixel counting in connected regions, and extracting these regions as separate images. It also provides convenient image scaling options, whether for a single image or its corresponding areas, along with basic number recognition capabilities using Euclidean distance and feature vectors, making it a comprehensive solution for various image processing tasks.

**Real Time Chat Room** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bbrayan/Sand_Castle)]: Sand Castle is a simple real-time chat room and a collaborative whiteboard. I made it with React, Node.js, and Socket.IO; it allows users to join with a username into a room and communicate with other group users. The UI has a few features, including a whiteboard and a text view showing all current users.


## Professional Experiences

**FullStack Developer, Brightsquid Secure Communications Corporation (Mar 2021 - Mar 2023,)**: I played a crucial role in designing and developing a HIPAA-compliant web-based messaging system that facilitates seamless communication between clinics and their patients. This system is actively used by a substantial user base, including 80,000 healthcare professionals and 395,000 patients across Canada and the US. Additionally, I contributed to creating an Appointment Reminder application, which involved integrating with various TELUS EMRs. This application streamlines the process of sending automated appointment reminders to patients, complete with pre-appointment questionnaires, significantly reducing No-Show rates.

**Student Analyst - QA, OMERS (May 2019 - Aug 2019,)**: I actively participated in the development, adaptation, and execution of test automation scripts using Selenium and Cypress to maintain the functional reliability of our applications. I collaborated closely with QA team colleagues and contributed to internal QA process enhancement initiatives. I conducted comprehensive reviews of test plans and case documents to ensure thorough test coverage.

**Instructor Assistant, Wilfrid Laurier University Waterloo Ontario (Sep 2018 - Apr 2018)**: Supported and marked over 100 students in Data Structures in Python, Java & C. Acted as a liaison between professor and student by providing weekly assignments through correspondence emails and assisting the students if needed.

**Student Analyst, Full Stack Developer, OMERS (May 2018 - Aug 2018)**: Participated in solution evaluation, developed Proof of Concepts (PoCs), ensuring code quality, optimized application performance and low maintenance cost, and maintained Application infrastructure. I was predominantly using front-end tools in the React framework.
