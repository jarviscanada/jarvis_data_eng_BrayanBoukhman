**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrayanBoukhman/tree/master/linux_sql)]: I developed a system to document and store hardware specs and resource usage for a Linux cluster in PostgreSQL. I created an MVP for Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration, including scripts to gather hardware data, track server usage, and launch PostgreSQL and its docker container. This resulted in a successful functional MVP for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration.
